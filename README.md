Known Issues:

-sometimes, rarely, media won't load. I currently have no idea why this happens.

Important notes:

- I use the free tier on render which means that the server shuts down after periods of inactivity. Should you attempt to visit the site, it may take longer than usual to load due to the server needing to start back up again. This one-off long load time is normal and will not be present for any future attempts to access the site so as long as there aren't any big periods of downtime between attempts.
